# Full-Stack E-Commerce Website

## Project Overview

This project is a **full-stack e-commerce website** designed with a modern frontend and a scalable backend architecture. The application emphasizes **clean system design, reusable backend logic, and clear separation of concerns** between the user interface and data layer.

The backend is built around a **MongoDB-based architecture** that supports structured data storage, flexible schemas, and scalable application growth, while the frontend delivers a responsive and customizable shopping experience.
